PF Style Bearded devils are easier to create, so I generated more of them. Also the Monster Manual describes bearded devils as "scaly skin,..., and claws that clearly show its fiendish nature" while showing an image of a humanoid with normal hands, kinda normal feet and unscaly skin. Also it never mentiones the skin color.
